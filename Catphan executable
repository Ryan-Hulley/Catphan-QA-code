#UCLH Catphan analysis software, edited by RH, last updated 05/05/2020, UCLH, Please contact ryan.hulley@nhs.net for any assitance.
from pylinac import CatPhan504
import easygui
folder = easygui.diropenbox()
mycbct = CatPhan504(folder) #This creates a mycbct object which we can then analyze.

# Perform analysis
mycbct.analyze() #This does the actual analysis of the .dcm files.

# Some properties:
print("##############################") #This makes it look nicer.
print("Number of images = {}".format(mycbct.num_images) ) #The .format places the thing inside the curly brackets {}. In this case it is the number of images.
print("CatPhan size = {}".format(mycbct.catphan_size) ) #Here we format it with the size of something.
print("mm per pixel = {}".format(mycbct.mm_per_pixel) ) #Here we give the number of mm per pixel.
print("##############################") #This makes it look nicer.

# Results standard output
print( mycbct.results() ) #This will print the results of the analysis. This is the same as what is later saved to a text file.

print("Analysis: COMPLETED")
print("Please use file naming convention, YYMMDD SITE. Site is whether it was a HEAD, THORAX or PELVIS scan. For repeat analysis on the same day add repeat 1 at the end of the file name")

#mycbct.plot_analyzed_image()
summaryFileName = input("Write the name of the file: ") #This asks the user to enter in a name for the file which will be saved.
mycbct.publish_pdf(summaryFileName+'.pdf', open_file=False) #This creates a pdf of the results. We do not open it as we will be editing it later on.
